                <p> Howdy, my name is Luke Ayers! I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas and I lived in Texas my whole life until I moved to Eugene, 
                Oregon for my first year of college in September of 2024. I have a passion for Aviation Photography and I have been participating in 
                this hobby since 2019. 
                </p>
            <h2>My story</h2>
                <p> On Christmas in 2019, I was gifted a Canon DSLR, sparking a newfound passion for photography. Not too long after that I started taking 
                    pictures of aircraft on approach to San Antonio International Airport (SAT) from my front yard, taking inspiration from an older
                    friend of mine who had already been planespotting for a while. My curiosity and excitement grew, and on December 31, 2019, I found 
                    myself planespotting in San Diego during a family vacation. As the pandemic took place in 2020, I found myself with 
                    more free time and dove deeper into planespotting. It was during this time that I began working with Airways Magazine 
                    (Airways Publishing LLC) in September joining their fantastic team of photographers. My dedication paid off, and in 2021, I saw my work 
                    published in a magazine for the first time, marking a significant milestone in my planespotting journey. As I continued further down 
                    the path of aviation photography, I continuously wanted to improve and do more. At first I had to rely on my parents for transportation 
                    to and from the airport in San Antonio, but  eventually, in December of 2021, almost exactly 2 years after my first time planespotting,
                    I finally got my license. At this point I took every chance possible to collect more photos of different aircraft or airlines I had yet 
                    to capture. More time passed, and I started to upgrade my gear, and this process will always be ongoing. Like most photographers and 
                    artists, I always strive to improve the quality of my work, and this was just another step in doing so.

            <h2>Why airplanes?</h2>
                <p> Ever since I started this hobby, I've had some people who think it's a weird or nerdy hobby, but it is a surprisingly large 
                    community, spanning countless platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Flickr, YouTube, and many more. Not only that, but 
                    there are many websites or databases full of images from photographers around the world. Websites like JetPhotos have been around 
                    2002, with over 4 million screened photos now available online for anyone to view. These websites provide all details of an aircraft,
                    including registration, serial number, photo location, and much more. The reason I enjoy this specific type of photography so much
                    is for many reasons. There are so many different airlines and aircraft types out there, leaving countless combinations for us
                    planespotters to capture through our lens. Getting up close and personal with these aircraft has always been fun for me, trying 
                    to perfect every shot just sharp enough to see all the intricate details of an aircraft. Most of all though, is collecting images
                    of rare aircraft or special liveries. For example, Southwest Airlines has a special paint scheme for many different state flags 
                    including Texas, California, Nevada, Tennessee, Colorado, Arizona, and more! As you can see by just a select gallery of images 
                    I have collected, there are many different aircraft for us planespotters to capture, and no single photographer can ever capture
                    them all.
